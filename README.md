In an era of burgeoning digital content, the demand for efficient language translation systems has surged. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly transformer models, this project aims to develop a sophisticated language translation system. The system's primary objective is to accurately translate between multiple language pairs while ensuring high fluency. By exploring various transformer-based models, including BERT, GPT, and the original Transformer architecture, the project seeks to harness state-of-the-art technology to address the complexities of language translation. Challenges such as linguistic idiosyncrasies, grammatical variations, and data scarcity across language pairs will be confronted to achieve optimal performance. The resulting system, named "Language Translation using NLP and Transformers," promises to offer a robust solution to the growing demand for efficient cross-language communication in the digital age.
Keywords: Natural Language Processing(NLP), Transformers.
